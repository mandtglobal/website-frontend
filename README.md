# M&T Global Website Frontend

## Project Overview

This repository contains the **frontend** of the M&T Global Construction Group's website, which is currently under development. This project aims to create an engaging and user-friendly interface to showcase M&T Global’s services, projects, and company information. The **backend and admin dashboard** will be integrated in future phases of the project, allowing for full functionality, including client interaction and internal management.

The website’s frontend is fully responsive and designed to deliver a seamless experience across different devices. This phase includes the **core UI elements**, **responsive layout**, and initial content structure. As the backend and dashboard components are added, the site will evolve to support dynamic features, user authentication, and administrative capabilities.
